## Important
I want you to be 100% happy with URL Increment Button! If something isn't working right, or if there's a feature you think is missing, [please open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/sixcious/url-increment-button/issues) and give me a chance to help before leaving a review.

## About
URL Increment Button is a simple 1-Click Button that can increment a URL for you. The button will try to increment the most likely number in the URL using its built-in algorithm (this is usually the last number). If it's not picking the right number you want, you can install and use "URL Incrementer" (separately available) to select the part of the URL you want to increment. The button will then increment the part you selected in URL Incrementer.

## Features
- Increments the URL (finds a number in the URL and then increments it by 1)
- A simple 1-Click Increment Button with no configuration or settings
- Works with URL Incrementer (separately available) so you can use its settings to increment if needed
- Requires no permissions
- Uses no background memory when not in use

## FAQ

#### What is the minimum browser version (and why is it to so high)?
The current minimum browser version is Chrome/Edge/Firefox `130`. I usually update the minimum browser version every time I do a release so I can use the latest and greatest ECMAScript features without worry. If your browser doesn't support it, I'm afraid you'll have to use another app/extension (sorry!).

#### Why is the production version's source code minified?
I use [Terser](https://github.com/terser/terser) to minify the source code for production releases that I upload to your browser's web store. I mainly do this because I write a lot of comments and `console.log()` statements for debugging and because it cuts down the file size significantly.

#### Where's the source code?
I've decided to make URL Increment Button proprietary, as it is only intended to be a standalone app or used with URL Incrementer. I may change this in the future, though (I thank you for your understanding).

## Permissions Justification
No permissions are needed.

## Privacy Policy
URL Increment Button does not track you. It does not use analytic services. It does not collect any data from your device or computer. All your data is stored locally on your device. Your data is *your* data.
