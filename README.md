## Important
I want you to be 100% happy with URL Increment Button! If something isn't working right, or if there's a feature you think is missing, [please open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/sixcious/url-increment-button/issues) and give me a chance to help before leaving a review.

## About
URL Increment Button is a simple 1-Click Button that can increment a URL for you. The button will try to increment the most likely number in the URL using its built-in algorithm (this is usually the last number). If it's not picking the right number you want, you can install and use "URL Incrementer" (separately available) to select the part of the URL you want to increment. The button will then increment the part you selected in URL Incrementer.

## Features
- Increments the URL (finds a number in the URL and then increments it by 1)
- A simple 1-Click Increment Button with no configuration or settings
- Works with URL Incrementer (separately available) so you can use its settings to increment if needed
- Requires no permissions
- Uses no background memory when not in use

## Permissions Justification
No permissions are needed.

## Privacy Policy
